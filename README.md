# Hubble Fix Chrome Extension

This extension replaces the images source on the Hubble Stargaze site with an IPFS mirror that provides better reliability without the 429 Too Many Requests errors.

## Installation

Visit chrome://extensions and enable developer mode.

Click "Load Unpacked"

Select the "hubble-fix" directory and load.

## Usage

Next time you visit hubble, the images should load from an alternate IPFS gateway instead of stargaze.mypinata.com. You may need to refresh the page depending on loading speed.
